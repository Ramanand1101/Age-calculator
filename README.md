## Files Included

1. `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for styling the Age Calculator web application. It defines the layout, colors, and appearance of the application's elements.

2. `script.js`: This JavaScript file is responsible for handling user interactions and performing the age calculation based on the selected date of birth.

## CSS Styling

The `style.css` file contains CSS rules for styling the application's elements. It defines the layout, colors, and fonts used in the application. Here are some key styling points:

- Setting global styles for all elements.
- Styling the container and calculator sections.
- Defining the appearance of the input box and button.
- Styling the result display.

## JavaScript Logic

The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code to handle user interactions and calculate the age based on the input date of birth. The `calculateAge()` function is called when the "Calculate" button is clicked, and it updates the result in the HTML.

Feel free to customize and enhance this Age Calculator as needed for your project. Happy coding!
